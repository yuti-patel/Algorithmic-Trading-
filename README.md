Algorithmic Trading: 

Algorithmic trading (also called automated trading, black-box trading, or algo-trading) uses a computer program that follows a defined set of instructions (an algorithm) to place a trade. The trade, in theory, can generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.
Algorithmic trading can be used for trend following strategies, index fund rebalancing etc. 

Bollinger Bands: 

Bollinger Bands are envelopes plotted at a standard deviation level above and below a simple moving average of the price. Because the distance of the bands is based on standard deviation, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price.Bollinger Bands use 2 parameters, Period and Standard Deviations, StdDev. The default values for period = 20 and stddev = 2. 

Typical values used:

Short term: 10 day moving average, bands at 1.5 standard deviations. (1.5 times the standard dev. +/- the SMA)

Medium term: 20 day moving average, bands at 2 standard deviations.

Long term: 50 day moving average, bands at 2.5 standard deviations.

Ichimoku Cloud: 

The Ichimoku Cloud is a type of chart used in technical analysis to display support and resistance, momentum, and trend in one view. TenkanSen and KijunSen are similar to moving averages and analyzed in relationship to one another.

There are five plots that make up the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. Their names and calculations are:

TenkanSen (Conversion Line): (High + Low) / 2 default period = 9
KijunSen (Base Line): (High + Low) / 2 default period = 26 
Chiku Span (Lagging Span): Price Close shifted back 26 bars 
Senkou A (Leading Span A): (TenkanSen + KijunSen) / 2 (Senkou A is shifted forward 26 bars) 
Senkou B (Leading Span B): (High + Low) / 2 using period = 52 (Senkou B is shifted forward 26 bars)
